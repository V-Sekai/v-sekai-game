V-Sekai is still in a pre-release state. It's highly experimental and still being evaluated for security. Use at your own risk.

## What is it?

V-Sekai is an open-source project that aims to bring social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), including:

- A generic multiplayer framework with VOIP support
- Tools for loading and generating arbitrary user-generated content from the Godot Engine.
- Avatar support with inverse kinematics.

## How do I get it?

V-Sekai is still in a pre-release state. We don't offer pre-packaged downloads yet. It's highly experimental and still being evaluated for security. Use at your own risk.

We also provide [preview builds](https://v-sekai.github.io/manuals/features/play_latest.html).

## How do I build it?

V-Sekai requires our [custom Godot Engine fork](https://github.com/v-sekai/godot) found under the `groups-4.2` branch. For information about building the Godot Engine, see the [official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/).
